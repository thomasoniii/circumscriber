# circumscriber

Just a little drawing toy I was playing with. You can see it online @ https://thomasoniii.github.io/circumscriber/

Download it, then:

```
npm install
npm run dev
open http://localhost:5173
```

It'll draw circles within circles, slightly recursively. You can even rotate things!

There's some cruft in the code. It's just a small toy exercise, after all.
